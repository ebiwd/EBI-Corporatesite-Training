outcomes: >-
  Participants should be able to:
  * submit all types of sequence data
  * submit supplementary interpreted data such as variant calls, alignment
  files, annotation tables
  * browse the ENA database in detail, learning about its structure and the type
  of data it contains

**The European Nucleotide Sequence Archive (ENA) is a global database for storing experimental nucleotide data and also interpreted data (alignment files, variant calling, analysis results). The data is submitted by scientists conducting sequencing experiments and publishing research in the area. Data is fully searchable and available for download. Sequence data includes raw NGS files (FastQ, BAM…), \_assembled genomes and transcriptomes, and annotated sequences (protein coding genes, non coding RNA, barcode genes, HLA genes …)**

The module is suitable for scientists that are producing sequence data and require a platform to publish it, and for bioinformaticians wishing to search and analyse 3rd party sequence data.
