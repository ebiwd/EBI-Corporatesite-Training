  Participants should be able to:


  * describe the principles of sequence similarity searching and sequence
  homology


  * use the different sequence similarity searching tools to find homologous
  sequences at EMBL-EBI and identify the appropriate tool for different
  applications

This module covers sequence similarity searching and alignment, using tools like BLAST and PSI-Search to find homologous sequences in EMBL-EBI databases, and pairwise and multiple sequence alignment tools like Clustal Omega to discover conserved regions of sequences and sequence relationships. It includes tips on which tool and database to use, input formats, how to change parameters and how to interpret the results pages.

The module is aimed at researchers interested in core bioinformatics techniques, sequence searching and alignment. No prior experience of bioinformatics is required, but an undergraduate level knowledge of molecular biology would be of benefit to those attending."
