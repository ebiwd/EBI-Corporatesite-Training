**This module gives researchers an overview of the major databases and tools at EMBL-EBI and help them identify resources to use in their work. A practical approach is taken including presentations, demonstrations and practical activities to give trainees hands-on experiences in using EMBL-EBI search tool to explore literature, genome, protein and small molecule data of interest. **

The module is suitable for all researchers who would like to learn about EMBL-EBI bioinformatics resources and tools, and apply them in their work. No previous bioinformatics experience is required, but an undergraduate level knowledge of biology or biochemistry would be an advantage.Â
